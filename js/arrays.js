//I decided to put the array and loop in separate file so it doesnt confuse me with the output//

var userAges = [18,19];
var users = ["subscribed", "unsubscribed"];

for (var counter = 0; counter < users.length; counter++){
    console.log(users[counter]);
}
for (var counter = 0; counter < userAges.length; counter++){
    console.log(userAges[counter]);
    
}
// I made two arrays and two loops //
